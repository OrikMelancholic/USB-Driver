Operating System acts a more and more important role in modern era. Among them,
the vast popular one is Linux, an open source and free operating system that
allows everyone to modify, contribute and redistribute. For a few years ago,
during the period of the publish of book Linux Device Driver, 3rd edition,
Linux is litter known to folks both in custom and enterprise fields. But, with
the rise of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, container technology and
serverless technology, Linux is becoming a center which glues each piece of the
components.

Linux, like any other free and open source software, has a great advantage for
its developers in viewing its internals. This superpower speeds the development
of Linux; it gathers the top developers worldwide, in which professional or
amateur, full time or part time, teacher or student developers are involved.
Once a time, that design and develop operating system were dark and mysterious
areas to common software programmer. The Linux kernel still remains one of the
most large and complex software in the world, and would-be kernel hackers need
an entry point where they can approch this giant monster without being 
overwhelmed by its immense mass.
